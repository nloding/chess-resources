  <h1>About</h1>
  <p class="text-lg paragraph">
    A long list of online chess resources. This list is forked from a list on rentry.co;
    the original list was blocked by many services, such as Reddit, making it hard for users to
    access and contribute. While that list provided the starting point, this site has further edited
    the list to exclude dead links, illegal/pirated material, and reorganized sections.

    If you have a resource you'd like to see added, or any suggestions to improve the list,
    visit the <a href="/contribute">Contribute page</a> to learn how!
