# Chess Resources

a curated list of chess resources

## What is this?

This is the source for https://chessresources.info, a curated list of online chess resources. There was list ciruclating in some chess forums that included many of these resources, but also included illegally pirated material. I didn't see any other lists like it but did not want to support pirating content, so I forked the list and built this simple website to display it.

The list of resources is not meant to be comprehensive. If you feel there is something missing, open an issue and let me know!
